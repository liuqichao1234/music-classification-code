All metadata and features for all tracks are distributed in fma_metadata.zip (342 MiB). The below tables can be used with pandas or any other data analysis tool. See the paper or the usage.ipynb notebook for a description.
tracks.csv: per track metadata such as ID, title, artist, genres, tags and play counts, for all 106,574 tracks.
genres.csv: all 163 genres with name and parent (used to infer the genre hierarchy and top-level genres).
features.csv: common features extracted with librosa.
echonest.csv: audio features provided by Echonest (now Spotify) for a subset of 13,129 tracks.

Then, you got various sizes of MP3-encoded audio data:
fma_small.zip: 8,000 tracks of 30s, 8 balanced genres (GTZAN-like) (7.2 GiB)
fma_medium.zip: 25,000 tracks of 30s, 16 unbalanced genres (22 GiB)
